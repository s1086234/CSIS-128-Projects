  <h2>Reviews</h2>
    <p>"The Slim Shady LP" debuted at the #2 spot on Billboards Top 200. This album helped put Eminem on the map. His message with "The Slim Shady LP" was directed towards America's poor white youth,
        but was also embraced by the average teen who hated their parents.</p>	
		
	<p>The offensive and controversial lyrics in "The Marshall Mathers LP" made adults hate him and teens love him. Being hated was essential to his appeal. His anger had no limits in this album,
	    and he took shots at everybody. As offensive as the lyrics are it is a beautiful masterpiece unlike any other.</p>
		
	<p>"The Eminem Show" may be one of his best albums. He reworks Aerosmith's "Dream on" and "Sing for the moment" and does a fantastic job doing so! In this album Eminem is rapping because the world has
        pissed him off. All the negativity towards him from the media and adults everywhere give him the ammo for his lyrical arsenal.	Though his lyrics are still offensive, Eminem seems to be a little calmer
		 in this album.</p>
