 <p>The history of Pit Bulls varies depending on the sources you refer too. Most advocates to agree 
 that they are decendents of bullbaiting dogs. In the 1700s there were two primary bullbaiting dogs, 
 the Blue Poll of Scotland and the Alunt of Ireland. People immigrating to the U.S. brought their dogs 
 with them in the 1700s through the 1800s. These dogs shared the work, by working as catch and farm dogs 
 to drive semi-wild cattle and hogs and hauling carts for miners. In early American bullbaiting and 
 dog-fighting was still a sport. Working men would match their dogs in the pits and gamble on them. 
 Ratting is a sport that emerged around this time. This involved placing a number of rats in a pit with a 
 dog for a specified period of time. The larger the number of rats killed, the higher the dog placed. 
 These dogs went by several names and became todayâ€™s American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, 
 and American Bulldog.</p>
